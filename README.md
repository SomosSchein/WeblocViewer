# WeblocViewer

Weblock Viewer is a Safari Bookmark (Webloc) File Viewer for Windows and Linux. Built for everyone who needs to open Safari’s bookmark files (created on macOS) directly on other Operating Systems (windows and linux). 
Project was born when I migrated from macOS to Windows and found out that couldn’t access hundreds of Bookmarks I did save as Shortcuts (not in browser), so I built this tool for that, and given that I couldn’t find an alternative I’m sharing it in case anyone needs the same functionality. 

## Usage

WeblocViewer is built using [.NET Core 3.1]("https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download") so you just need to Compile, set the .exe as default app for file type and you're ready to go.
